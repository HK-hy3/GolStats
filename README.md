This is a project for Innovate India where we use ASUSE's 3 years of data to analysis the road accidents 
Road Accident Analysis: Methods, Insights, and Visualization

📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes road accident trends in India using data from the All-India Survey on Unorganized Sector Employment (ASUSE). The goal is to understand accident patterns, assess employment-related risks, and provide data-driven policy recommendations to improve road safety.
We leverage Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly to process, visualize, and extract insights from accident data.

📂 Dataset

Primary Dataset: ASUSE (2021, 2022, 2023)

Additional Data Sources:
National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB)
Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH)
Open Government Data (OGD) Platform

Key Variables Considered:
Number of accidents per employment sector
Occupation-based accident risks (e.g., transport, gig economy workers)
Geographic distribution of accidents
Economic impact (medical costs, productivity losses, insurance claims)


🛠️ Methodology

Data Preprocessing
Converted Parquet files to CSV.

Cleaned and merged ASUSE data with other sources.

Created new features such as accident risk per occupation and road safety index by region.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed sector-wise accident distribution.

Examined geographic hotspots.

Identified time-based trends in accident occurrences.

Data Visualization

Heatmaps for accident-prone areas.

Bar charts & histograms for employment risk analysis.

Time-series plots for accident trends over the years.

Policy Recommendations

Training programs for high-risk workers.

Strengthening employer insurance policies.

Improving road infrastructure in accident-prone zones.

📊 Key Visualizations

Heatmaps: Identify high-accident zones.

Bar Charts: Compare accident risk across employment sectors.

Time-Series Analysis: Detect accident trends over multiple years.

Interactive Dashboards: Allow real-time accident monitoring for policymakers.

🚀 Future Enhancements

Implement machine learning models to predict high-risk accident zones.

Automate real-time data integration with traffic monitoring systems.

Expand the dataset to include global accident statistics.
